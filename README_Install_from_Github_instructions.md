(Note these instructions were AI generated by Copilot)

These steps show how to download and install the APK from the official GitHub Releases page on your Android phone.

- Always-current latest release:
  - https://github.com/roblatour/YetAnotherTimer/releases/latest

Note: On the release page, look under the Assets section and tap the file that ends with .apk. The exact filename usually includes the version number (for example, YetAnotherTimer-v1.0.0.0.apk).

### What you’ll need
- An Android phone (Android 6.0+ recommended)
- A web browser (Chrome is recommended; Samsung Internet or Firefox also work)
- A stable internet connection and enough free storage space

### Step 1 — Download the APK
1. Open your browser on the phone and go to the v1.0.0.0 link above (or the latest link).
2. Scroll to the Assets section and tap the .apk to download it.
3. If a warning appears like “This type of file can harm your device,” tap Download anyway.
4. Wait for the download to complete. In Chrome, check progress via Menu → Downloads.

### Step 2 — Install the APK
1. When the download finishes, tap Open in the browser’s download prompt.
   - If you don’t see an Open button: open the Files (or My Files) app → Downloads and tap the APK; or in Chrome go to Menu → Downloads and tap the APK there.
2. If you see “For your security, your phone is not allowed to install unknown apps from this source”:
   - Tap Settings on the prompt.
   - Enable “Allow from this source” for your browser (e.g., Chrome).
   - Return to the installer and tap Install again.
3. When prompted, tap Install. After installation, tap Open to launch Yet Another Timer.

### About “Install unknown apps” (Android 8+)
Android requires a per-app permission to install apps from outside the Play Store.
- Typical path (stock Android / Pixel): Settings → Apps → [Your browser] → Install unknown apps → Allow from this source.
- Samsung: Settings → Apps → [Your browser] → Install unknown apps → Allow from this source.
- Alternate route on Android 12+: Settings → Apps → Special app access → Install unknown apps → [Your browser] → Allow.
- Older devices (Android 7 and below): Settings → Security → Unknown sources.

Tip: You can turn this permission off again after installing.

### Play Protect and other warnings
- If Google Play Protect shows a warning, tap More details → Install anyway only if you trust the source. This APK is provided via the official GitHub Releases page above.
- If your device is managed by a company/work profile, policies may block installing from unknown sources.

### Updating to a newer version
- Visit the Releases page again and download the newer .apk, then install it.
- If the new APK is signed with the same key, it will update in place and preserve your data.
- If you see “App not installed” due to a signature mismatch, uninstall the currently installed version first (this may remove local data), then install the new APK.

### Uninstalling
- Press and hold the Yet Another Timer app icon → Uninstall; or
- Go to Settings → Apps → Yet Another Timer → Uninstall.

### Troubleshooting
- “App not installed”
  - Ensure “Allow from this source” is enabled for your browser.
  - Uninstall any older version signed with a different key.
  - Free up storage and try again.
  - Re-download the APK in case it was corrupted.
  - Some devices may not be compatible with this build/Android version.
- Can’t find the downloaded file
  - In Chrome: Menu → Downloads; or open your Files app → Downloads.
- Install button is greyed out
  - Temporarily disable any screen overlay or blue-light filter apps.
- Play Protect blocks the install
  - Tap More details → Install anyway if available and you trust the source. If there’s no option, try later or another network/profile.

### Security notes
- Only download the APK from the official Releases page listed above.
- Avoid sharing APK files directly via messaging apps—share the Releases link instead.
