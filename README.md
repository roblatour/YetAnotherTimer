# Yet Another Timer v1.0 (for Android) - 2025-10-16

Open source timer for Android

# Background

I made this app for my own personal use - using it at the gym to count down rest periods between reps.  However, after it was done I thought it would be a good idea to make a few enhancements so that I could share it - like adding in support for different languages.

In any case, your welcome to use it for anything you like and/or to learn about Android code development.  

Also, I am currently going through the process of making this app available on the Google Play Store.  When that completes (likely around the start of November 2025) I will update this document with a link.

Finally, to give credit where credit is due, most of the coding for this project was done by the Copilot AI. I had to step in from time to time to get things working but Copilot did all of the heavy lifting - so cool.
